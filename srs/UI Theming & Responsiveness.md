You are an expert in Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for Next.js.

I need to refine the **theming and responsiveness** of my legal PDF platform:
1. Must support a professional look (light/dark mode?), consistent with Shadcn guidelines: https://github.com/shadcn/ui
2. Desktop-first but also functional on tablet and mobile for simpler tasks.
3. UI scaling for large monitors (lawyers often have big screens).
4. The SRS states we want a modern, accessible design with proper color contrast for highlights, role-based color tags, etc.

Please cover:
- How to set up global theming (light/dark toggles, custom brand colors).
- How to incorporate color-coded annotation categories (like “Issue=Yellow, Ruling=Red, etc.”) in a consistent theme approach.
- Responsive layout best practices (flex, grid, breakpoints, sidebars that collapse or slide).
- Examples of key Shadcn components used (e.g. Menus, Tabs, Dialogs, TreeView-like structures).
- Accessibility guidelines (ARIA roles, keyboard nav).
- Code snippet or pseudocode references.

Conclude with advanced tips (e.g. dynamic theming for multiple firm brand palettes, or measuring color contrast compliance).
