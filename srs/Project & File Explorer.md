You are an expert in React, Next.js (App Router), and enterprise-grade UI design.

Please help me build the **Left Sidebar** (Project & File Explorer) for my Next.js 14 application that manages large sets of legal PDFs. 

Requirements and references:
1. Emulate the look/feel of VSCodeâ€™s explorer, including a file tree, folder/file icons, search, and history. 
2. Support multi-project navigation (project switcher at top).
3. Provide right-click context menus for rename, delete, move, new folder, new file (PDF), with drag-and-drop for reorganizing.
4. Integrate search functionality across documents, referencing textual content or AI-based semantic search in future.
5. Use Shadcn/UI for styling and ensure a professional, accessible design.
6. Follow the details in my SRS: [Paste or link the SRS snippet relevant to left sidebar]
7. References: 
   - VSCode web: https://vscode.dev
   - Shadcn/UI: https://github.com/shadcn/ui

Please break down the final design into:
- Data structures (e.g. how projects, folders, files are stored)
- React components needed
- State management approach (local vs. server data fetching)
- Key interactions (click, drag-drop, rename, etc.)
- full code snipets! 
- Best practices for performance and UX

End with suggestions for test cases and potential future enhancements (like plugin hooks for additional file actions).
