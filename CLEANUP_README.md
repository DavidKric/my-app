# Project Cleanup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the cleanup performed on the project to organize code, eliminate duplicates, and maintain a clean structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. PDF Components Consolidation
- Consolidated all PDF-related components into `components/pdf_viewer/`
- Removed duplicate directories:
  - `components/pdf-viewer/`
  - `components/pdf/`
  - `components/pdf-core/`
  - `components/pdf-annotations/`
  - `components/pdf-toolbar/`
- Organized components into logical subdirectories:
  - `core/` - Core PDF viewer components
  - `annotations/` - Annotation-related components
  - `controls/` - Toolbar and control components
  - `utils/` - Utility components

### 2. Test Directories Cleanup
- Removed redundant test directories:
  - `app/test-pdf/`
  - `app/test-direct/`
  - `app/test-proxy/`
  - `app/test-minimal/`
  - `app/test-img-backup/`
  - `app/test-ultra-basic/`
  - `app/direct-pdf/`
  - `app/debug-pdf/`
  - `app/pdf-demo/`
  - `app/pdf-viewer/`

### 3. Configuration Files
- Removed duplicate `next.config.ts` (kept standard `next.config.js`)

### 4. PDF Setup
- Removed duplicate PDF setup files at the root level
- Maintained the centralized PDF setup in `my-app/lib/pdf-setup.ts`

### 5. PDF Worker Configuration Refactoring
- Improved the PDF.js worker configuration in `lib/pdf-setup.ts`:
  - Added a cascading approach that tries multiple sources for the PDF worker
  - Prioritizes a local worker file, then CDN, then falls back to an inline minimal worker
- Added a script to automatically copy the worker file to the public directory:
  - Created `scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js` to handle worker file copying
  - Updated package.json to run this script before both dev and build commands
  - Created documentation in [PDF_WORKER_SETUP.md](PDF_WORKER_SETUP.md) explaining the approach

## Current Project Structure
The main components of the application are now organized as follows:

- `app/` - Next.js application routes
  - `workspace/` - Main workspace area
    - `viewer/` - PDF viewer page
- `components/` - React components
  - `pdf_viewer/` - All PDF-related components
  - `context_panel/` - Context and annotation panels
  - `ui/` - UI components
- `lib/` - Utility libraries
  - `pdf-setup.ts` - PDF.js initialization
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
  - `copy-pdf-worker.js` - Script to copy the PDF worker file to public directory
- `public/` - Static files
  - `pdf.worker.min.js` - PDF.js worker file (copied by script)

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider further consolidating similar functionality
2. Implement a consistent naming convention (kebab-case or snake_case)
3. Add proper JSDoc comments to improve code documentation
4. Set up linting rules to maintain code quality standards
